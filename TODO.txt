Ideas:
	Classes:
		Runner/Scout:
			Small damage output, most mobile of the classes, gains health from picking up money.
			Could have a way to slow enemies down or do small amounts damage over time (bleeding, corrosion)?

		Constructor/Builder:
			Medium damage output, can place and repair buildings.
			Can buy buildings cheaper by using resources?

		Fighter/Brawler:
			High burst damage, melee only weapons, high health and speed.

		Gunner/Rifleman:
			High damage output, can use most ranged weapons, low health and medium speed.
			Can buy armour for more protection?

		Healer/Medic:
			No damage output, heals players (SWEP or AoE?), creates portable ballistic shields.
			Maybe they can make certain players invulnerable for a short while?

		Bomber:
			High AoE burst damage, uses a grenades and rockets, can lay explosive traps.

	Buildings:
		Spawnpoint:
			A location to spawn players faster, each spawner reduces spawn times by 5% for a maximum of 50%, price increases 50% for each spawnpoint.

		Ammo Dispenser:
			A destructible container that generates resources and ammo over time.
			Can be upgraded to increase range and ammo capacity?

		Tar Traps:
			Slows enemies down considerably (-80% move speed?) when they walk over it, only covers a small area.
			Could be a one use SWEP for the runner to throw?

		Weapon Upgrader:
			Can be used to upgrade weapon damage, range, or ammo capacity for large amounts of currency.
